# layton-solvers
A collection of any programs I write to automatically solve Professor Layton puzzles that I struggle to solve with my own brain.

I refuse to look up solutions other people have conceived for puzzles I struggle with, but I see writing a program which solves the puzzle for me to be in the spirit of puzzle-solving and just as fun, if not more so, than solving said puzzles traditionally. And thus these programs were born.

See individual directories for distinct puzzles. Each program is accompanied by a README explaining the puzzle and any usage quirks and a Makefile for simple compilation using GCC. Directories are named after the names given to puzzles in the North American localizations of Professor Layton games, as those are the versions I've played.

All programs here have been written solely by me for my own usage.
